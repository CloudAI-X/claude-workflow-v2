# install-claude-workflow-v2

Install the Claude Code workflow plugin with a single command.

## Usage

```bash
npm exec install-claude-workflow-v2@latest
```

Or with npx:

```bash
npx --yes install-claude-workflow-v2@latest
```

That's it. Run `claude` to start.

## What Gets Installed

```
.claude/
├── agents/      # 7 specialized subagents
├── skills/      # 14 knowledge domains
├── commands/    # 26 slash commands
└── hooks/       # 14 automation scripts
```

Hook scripts are copied into `.claude/hooks/` and registered in `.claude/settings.json` (existing files and settings are kept). Commands are not namespaced (`/commit` instead of `/project-starter:commit`), and `permissionMode: acceptEdits` on the debugger, docs-writer, refactorer and test-architect agents takes effect.

- **Additive install** - Preserves your existing `.claude/` files
- **No git history** - Downloads clean tarball, not full repo
- **Single command** - No configuration needed

## Requirements
